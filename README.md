# ‚ö° nFetch

<img src="./screenshot.png" />

‚ö° nFetch is a dependency-free, fast system information fetching tool aiming for maximum customizability on peek performance

### üé® Customization

#### Ascii-art
The ascii-art must be set in `~/.config/nfetch/art.txt`

A rich config implementation will be coming soon!

### üí≠ Why?
I wanted a system fetching tool for the look. Sadly, the ones i saw where not what i wanted and neofetch is too slow for my liking. This is where go and boredom came into place.

### üí™ Goal
My goal was to not use any dependencies. I wanted to achieve maximum performance while fetching accurate informations. My next goal is to implememt a config system, add more available informations and publish it to some package repositories to make installation easier.
